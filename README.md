🖥️ RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program – VSD
Welcome to my SoC Tapeout journey with VSD!
This repository chronicles my weekly milestones as I progress through the program.

The program guides us through the complete SoC design flow — from RTL coding to final GDSII — leveraging open-source EDA tools. As part of India’s largest RISC-V tapeout initiative with 3500+ contributors, it’s an exciting step in building our semiconductor ecosystem.
